<center><h1>Word "table" in cyrillic (4 symbols) is a key.</h1></center>
<p>ACHTUNG. Alphabet which was used to encrypt the message consists of 32 symbols:
all russian non-capital letters excluding letter "jo". Spaces are not considered as a symbol, 
they are already in the right places.</p>
<p>Another QR code leads to some information about encryption. If you are going to decrypt this,
you are recommended to read this first.</p>
<p><b>SORRY FOR WRITING IN ENGLISH, THIS HOSTING PLATFORM DOES NOT SUPPORT CYRILLIC SYMBOLS.</b></p>
<p>Wish you good luck</p>
